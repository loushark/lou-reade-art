      <h3>Hello!</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Lou and this is my creative mishmash of mixed media adventures!
      </p>
      <p>
        I am based in London, which is a nifty little place.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am available for work and exhibitions and creative projects come rain or shine!
      </p>
      <p>
        It would be fab to make some more illustrations, so if you need some hand drawn doodles for something-or-other, do contact me!
