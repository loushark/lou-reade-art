  <h3>SAN FRANCISCO</h3>
  <p>
    This collection of work began after a quick visit to the city back in 2010. The visit was inspiring, with an awe of fresh Californian light. The hills of San Francisco gave the already beautiful architecture an interesting layered and stacking effect, which in turn became my muse to further develop my art when I returned to the UK.

    <br>
    As i developed my artwork, I became intensely interested in the way the buildings overlapped each other, seeming to create quite an abstract reality. The process for my San Francisco work remains usually quite exaggerated; distinct from the citys first impression of natural colours and careful geometry, yet each expressive mark holds a certain truth.

    A solo exhibition of this series was shown at the Philadelphia Street gallery in Cabot Circus, Bristol.
